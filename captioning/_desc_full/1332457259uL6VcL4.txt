The image shows a woman with blonde hair wearing a black leather jacket and a black top. She is making a peace sign with her fingers, and her mouth is open, revealing her teeth. The woman is standing in front of a wooden wall, which has a hook on it. The woman's position and the objects in the image suggest that she might be in a public or semi-public setting.
