A woman stands in a cozy kitchen, her back to the camera. She is wearing a white apron tied around her waist, and her body is partially covered by it. The kitchen features wooden cabinets and a black stove, with a microwave and a coffee maker visible on the counter. A red and white striped towel hangs on the wall, and a red and white striped towel is draped over the counter.
