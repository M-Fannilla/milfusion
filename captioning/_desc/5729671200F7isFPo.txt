The image depicts a woman lying on her stomach on a bed, with her arms and legs spread out. She is wearing a red and white striped shirt and has a tattoo on her left arm. The bed is covered with a plaid blanket, and a white pillow is placed behind her. The woman's bare chest and the red and white striped shirt create a striking contrast against the plaid blanket.
