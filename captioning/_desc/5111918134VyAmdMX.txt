The image depicts a bare-chested woman standing on a patterned rug in a bedroom. She is wearing black stockings and appears to be adjusting them. The room has a blue and white color scheme, with a bed visible in the background. A lamp is present in the room, and a vase can be seen on a surface nearby. The woman's bareness and the black stockings create a striking contrast against the colorful and textured elements of the room.
