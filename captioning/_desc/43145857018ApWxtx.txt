The image is a black and white photograph of a woman in a pose that suggests she is in the middle of a squatting position. She is bare-chested, with her arms resting on her knees, and her legs are bent at the knees. The woman is positioned in front of a doorway, which serves as the backdrop for the photograph. The image is taken from a low angle, looking up at the woman, which adds a sense of depth and perspective to the scene.
