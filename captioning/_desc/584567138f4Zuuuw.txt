In the image, a woman is seated comfortably in an office chair, positioned in front of a desk. She is wearing a beige dress and is holding a glass of water in her hand. The room has a window that allows natural light to enter, and a radiator is visible on the wall. The desk is made of wood and has a phone and a book on it. The woman's position and the objects in the room suggest a professional setting.
