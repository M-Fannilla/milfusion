The colors in the image are predominantly earth tones, with the woman's clothing providing a pop of color. The textures of the stone stairs and the woman's clothing create a contrast between the natural and man-made elements. The composition of the image places the woman as the focal point, with the stairs and garden forming the backdrop.
