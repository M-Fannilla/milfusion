In the image, a woman is sitting on a black wicker chair, her legs crossed in a relaxed manner. She is wearing a white shirt and yellow sandals, and her bare chest is exposed. The chair is positioned against a wooden wall, and a window can be seen in the background. The woman's pose and the objects in the image create a visually striking composition.
