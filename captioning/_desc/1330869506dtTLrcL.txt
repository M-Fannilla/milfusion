The image depicts a woman wearing an orange robe with a lace collar, standing in front of a window with white blinds. The woman's hands are clasped together in front of her, and she is making a face, possibly in a playful or humorous manner. The background features a yellow wall, which contrasts with the orange of the woman's robe and adds a warm hue to the scene.
