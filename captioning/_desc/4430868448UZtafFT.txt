The image depicts a naked woman sitting on a wooden floor in a room with a zebra print rug. She is holding a can of spray paint in her right hand. The room is filled with various potted plants, and a window with white blinds can be seen in the background. The woman's bare chest and legs, along with the can of spray paint, create a striking contrast against the neutral tones of the room.
