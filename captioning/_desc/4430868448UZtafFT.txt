In the image, a woman is seated on a stationary bike in a room with a wooden floor and a zebra print rug. She is barefoot and has her legs crossed, with her hands resting on the handlebars of the stationary bike. The room is filled with various potted plants, and a window with white blinds can be seen in the background.
