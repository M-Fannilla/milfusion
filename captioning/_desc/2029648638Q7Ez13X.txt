The image shows a person's backside, with a large, round, and smooth area of skin visible. The person is standing on a gray and white chevron-patterned rug, which contrasts with the wooden floor beneath. In the background, there is a table with a bottle of lotion and a glass of wine. The person's posture suggests they are bending over, possibly to pick something up from the table.
