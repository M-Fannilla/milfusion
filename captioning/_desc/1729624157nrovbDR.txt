A woman is sitting on a brown couch, wearing glasses and holding a green phone in her hands. She is also wearing a tattoo on her left arm. The couch is positioned against a gray wall, and a white door is visible in the background. On the floor next to the couch, there is a blue towel and a black and white striped pillow.
